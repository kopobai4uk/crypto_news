This makes it the third biggest Grayscale trust after the Bitcoin Trust with <a href=\"https://grayscale.co/bitcoin-trust/\">$31.2bn</a> AUM and the Ethereum Trust with <a href=\"https://grayscale.co/ethereum-trust/\">$4.7bn</a> AUM.</p><h2>The benefits of investing in Grayscale</h2><p>Grayscale is a regulated investment company, registering its shares with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It operates several single asset and multi-asset cryptocurrency trusts, which are the first digital currency investment vehicles to obtain the SEC\u2019s approval.</p><p>The trusts allow accredited investors, usually institutions and high net worth individuals, exposure to cryptocurrency through buying and selling of its publicly traded shares.</p><p>Investors trade these shares on the <a href=\"https://www.otcmarkets.com/index.html\">OTCQX</a>, which is an over-the-counter market operating under Alternative Reporting Standards. This means they are not required to register with the SEC.</p><p>Buying shares in a Grayscale trust versus buying crypto directly is advantageous because it allows for hassle-free exposure to cryptocurrency. Particularly concerning the safe storage and custody of crypto assets.</p><p>There is also the added benefit of more explicit tax rules concerning shares, meaning investors can hold them in particular tax-advantaged accounts, such as a Roth IRA.</p><h2>There\u2019s a price to pay for investing in the Grayscale Litecoin Trust</h2><p>But this comes at a price. First, Grayscale charges an <a href=\"https://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Grayscale-One-Pager-February-2021.pdf\">annual fee</a>, varying between 2% to 3%, depending on the trust. The Litecoin Trust charges an annual fee of 2.5%.</p><p>There\u2019s also the issue of \u201cpremium,\u201d which refers to the difference between the value of the holdings of the trust vs. the market price of the holdings. Grayscale\u2019s current Litecoin per-share value is 0.09276776, and with a current LTC price of $175, this means each Grayscale Litecoin Trust share (LTCN) is equivalent to $15.75 of Litecoin. But the current price of LTCN is $319.</p><p>That equates to a premium of over 1,900% \u2013 a staggering difference to pay versus direct exposure.</p><p>Nonetheless, news of Grayscale buying significant quantities of Litecoin suggests that this does not phase institutional investors.</p><p>The response to Grayscale buys and (potential) listings have earned the firm a reputation as a bullish market mover. Rumors of a Chainlink Trust triggered a <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/new-grayscale-trust-filings-spin-rumour-mill-into-overdrive-for-cardano-polkadot-cosmos-and-more/\">20%</a> breakout for LINK at the end of January.</p><p>Since Litecoin announced the Grayscale buy, the price of LTC made a $10 swing to close yesterday up 6%. Commenting on the relatively modest increase, Litecoin <a href=\"https://twitter.com/litecoin/status/1366620971185102849\">tweeted</a> that OTC orders do not immediately impact the market.</p><div

The proceeds from the sell-off will be used to purchase Cardano and Polkadot, as the fund\u2019s managing director says he believes ADA, DOT, and ETH will be the foundation of Web 3.0.</p><h2>Cardano and Polkadot get backing from a major crypto fund</h2><p>The crypto industry has been ripe with news of major financial institutions and enterprises acquiring huge amounts of Bitcoin. From Jack Dorsey\u2019s <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/square-allocates-one-percent-of-its-total-assets-to-bitcoin/\">Square</a> leading the pack with its massive BTC purchases last year and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-shortage-paypal-bought-70-of-all-mined-btc-last-month/\">PayPal\u2019s</a> and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/visa-aiming-mass-adoption-with-crypto-pilot-scheme-for-banks/\">Visa\u2019s</a> crypto payment functionality to <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/microstrategy-buys-another-1-billion-worth-of-bitcoin/\">MicroStrategy\u2019s</a> and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/tesla-made-more-money-buying-btc-in-one-day-than-it-did-selling-cars-last-quarter/\">Tesla\u2019s</a> billion-dollar acquisitions\u2014there seems to be a corporate race to accumulate Bitcoin.</p><p>However, a major cryptocurrency fund in Dubai has decided to go a different route and sell-off most of its Bitcoin holdings. FD7, a global crypto investment fund with $1 billion in assets under management (AUM), announced that it plans on selling $750 million of its <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/\">BTC</a> holdings in the next month.</p><p>According to the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210225005902/en/Global-Crypto-Investment-Fund-FD7-Ventures-to-Sell-750M-USD-Worth-of-Bitcoin-to-Increase-Cardano-and-Polkadot-Holdings\">press release</a>, the proceeds from the sell-off will be used to increase the company\u2019s positions in <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/cardano/\">Cardano</a> (ADA) and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/polkadot/\">Polkadot</a> (DOT). The increase in DOT and ADA holdings will better serve the needs of FD7 investors, the company explained in the release.</p><h2>The fund\u2019s managing director deems Bitcoin \u201cuseless\u201d as a store of value</h2><p>Prakash Chand, the managing director at FD7 Ventures, said that the fund\u2019s investors want to diversify their portfolios in the crypto space.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAside from the fact that Bitcoin was first to market and society has given it meaning as a store of value, I think Bitcoin is actually pretty useless,\u201d he said in the company\u2019s press release. \u201cProjects such as Cardano, Polkadot, and Ethereum are the foundation of the new internet and Web 3.0.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>And it\u2019s not just portfolio diversification that pushed the fund to Cardano and Polkadot. The company said that both the founder of Cardano, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/charles-hoskinson/\">Charles Hoskinson</a>, and the founder of Polkadot, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/gavin-wood/\">Dr. Gavin Wood</a>, are considered to be \u201ctwo of the brightest minds\u201d working in crypto. Both, the company further explained, lead projects it believes will have the potential for significant worldwide impact. Chand noted that he was convinced <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/\">Ethereum</a>, Cardano, and Polkadot will be more valuable than Bitcoin within the next few years, which is why the company was trying to front-run the market and expose their investors to the growing assets.</p><div class=\"link-page\"></div><div class=\"posted-in\">Posted In: <a

The significant growth in new addresses on the network was partly fueled by the upgrade to Daedalus which will introduce native-asset support to the wallet.</p><h2>The Cardano network sees significant expansion ahead of native asset upgrade</h2><p>With the clock counting down the final hours before the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/todays-mary-hard-fork-will-bring-cardano-one-step-closer-to-goguen/\">Mary hard fork</a>, the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/cardano/\">Cardano</a> network reached two major milestones that are set to propel the network to the top of the industry.</p><p>IOHK, the company behind Cardano, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1366157590602932225\">announced</a> today that it has released the first version of the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/products/daedalus/\">Daedalus</a> wallet with multi-asset support. According to the company\u2019s release, the Daedalus v. 4.0.0-RC1 was released to the Cardano public testnet on Mar. 1.</p><p>Later in the day, the company is set to release a Daedalus Flight wallet timed with the Mary Hard Fork Combinator (HFC) event. The rest of the market, however, will have to wait a bit before the full version of Daedalus is released. IOHK said that the wallet will be fully released after final user experience testing with the Flight community and any last-minute UI tweaks.</p><p>Daedalus is the most popular Cardano wallet. The current version will enable developers and stake pool operators (SPOs) to test sending and receiving native tokens alongside ADA. Once the wallet is fully released, it will also feature a brand new interface and UI.</p><h2>Half a million unique wallet addresses on Cardano await for Mary</h2><p>Just as IOHK announced the latest version of Daedalus, the Cardano network crossed another major milestone. While it\u2019s hard to pinpoint a single factor that contributed to the massive rise in users on the blockchain, the upcoming Mary hard fork and increased functionality of the network could be the ones to blame.</p><p><a href=\"https://adastat.net/\">According to</a> the latest data from AdaStat, there are currently 506,538 total unique wallet addresses on the Cardano network. With 294,682 delegators, this means that over 58 percent of all of the addresses on the Cardano blockchain have their funds staked to support the network.</p><p>Further data from AdaPools and AdaStat showed that the average amount of ADA per delegated wallets has been steadily decreasing this year, further strengthening Cardano\u2019s decentralization and distributing power to a large number of network participants.</p><figure style=\"width: 803px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

And when asked about his apparent tolerance for high-risk, Suarez replied by saying all investments are risky.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me at all the Treasury Secretary would find a decentralized potential currency to be hostile to a currency they control.</p><p>For people who invest in Bitcoin, the lure is precisely that it\u2019s not backed by a central government.

The announcement garnered a mixed response. Some praised the unconventional approach to municipal budgeting. Others blasted the idea by regurgitating FUD, including accusations of it being a Ponzi scheme and its failings as a currency.</p><p>Nonetheless, Suarez has pushed ahead with plans to integrate Bitcoin into Miami life. In February, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/miami-mayor-pushes-crypto-with-offer-to-pay-workers-in-bitcoin\">he</a> proposed paying city workers and collecting taxes in Bitcoin.</p><p>The city\u2019s commission approved the proposal in a 4-1 result. But only after downgrading the original plan to a study into the practicality of doing so.</p><p>Commissioner Manolo Reyes voiced caution, saying we need more information before jumping in. However, he remains committed to the study and open to finding out more.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cLet\u2019s analyze this before we jump in. Maybe you\u2019re ahead of your time, maybe you\u2019re right, but let\u2019s analyze it.\u201d</p></blockquote><h2>Yellen doesn\u2019t hold back in blasting BTC</h2><p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/yellen-sounds-warning-about-extremely-inefficient-bitcoin.html\">Treasury Secretary Yellen</a> issued a warning on the dangers of Bitcoin, saying it\u2019s often used in illicit finance while also slamming its environmental impact.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cTo the extent it is used I fear it\u2019s often for illicit finance. It\u2019s an extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions, and the amount of energy that\u2019s consumed in processing those transactions is staggering.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>She also criticized the leading cryptocurrency on the grounds of its extreme volatility, which she fears will leave investors exposed to losses.</p><div class=\"link-page\"></div><div

You visit an NFT sales platform like OpenSea, NiftyGateway, or the CryptoPunks site itself, find a punk you like, and pay the requisite ETH to gain ownership of that forever.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But yesterday saw a case of a punk sale gone wrong, with the owner ending up with only a few pennies (instead of thousands of dollars) and a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sniper</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> trader bagging a punk for almost nothing.</span></p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/pwCSfb81Re\">https://t.co/pwCSfb81Re</a></p><p>Punk #1737 received a legitimate 26.25 bid and accepted, but before his tx hit the chain, a contract flashloaned 26.25 eth + 1 wei and bid himself.

Each interaction on the network is validated by a miner, an entity that uses its resources to maintain the network and earn rewards in return. The user includes a \u201cgas\u201d fee for miners who may choose to take the offer up, process the transaction, and pocket the fees.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means all bids are temporarily flashed on blockchain for everyone to see. It also means it opens up possibilities for predatory miners or traders to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">front-run</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the bid and pocket a better deal.</span></p><h2><b>CryptoPunks front run</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such a situation resulted in the seller of Punk #1737 being front run by another trader/miner and losing out on the deal. They basically flashed a transaction to the network\u2014and in the same transaction\u2014got filled by someone else who accepted the bid, added a bit more (via a flash loan on Aave), and pocketed the deal.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTo clarify, bids could always snipe with slightly higher bids, that\u2019s not the issue. The problem is that the contract doesn\u2019t collect the entire bid amount for the seller if that eth is removed (back to AAVE here) in the same transaction,\u201d explained Arad in a separate tweet.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, as unjust as the above sounds, the method was not illegal in any way (ill-intended, but not illegal). The CryptoPunks protocol itself has not been damaged or affected, and neither is there a problem with Ethereum.</span></p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There is nothing to be stressed about.

And while this might seem like a huge technical conundrum, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/companies/input-output-iohk/\">IOHK</a>\u2019s engineers have actually come up with a rather simple, free-market-oriented solution.</p><h2>Cardano\u2019s Extended UTXO makes native token transactions possible</h2><p>Aside from opening up the world of DeFi to its users, the addition of <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/how-cardano-will-handle-native-tokens-on-its-platform/\">native tokens</a> to the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/cardano/\">Cardano</a> blockchain comes with a whole new set of technological benefits. The biggest advancement made possible by native tokens is Babel fees, a mechanism that enables users to pay transaction fees on the blockchain with user-defined tokens, rather than just using the blockchain\u2019s native token.</p><p>In practice, this means that any token issued on Cardano can be used to pay transaction fees, a move that will enable users to completely circumvent the use of ADA.</p><p>This is made possible by Cardano Extended<a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/cardano-parent-iohk-partners-with-nervos-to-improve-smart-contract-security/\"> UTXO</a> (EUTXO) model. Unlike <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/\">Ethereum</a>\u2019s account-based model, issuing a valid transaction on Cardano requires consuming one or more UTXOs. However, a UTXO on Cardano is able to carry a bundle that contains multiple different tokens, both fungible and non-fungible.</p><p>According to a <a href=\"https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/25/babel-fees/\">blog post</a> by Prof. Aggelos Kiayias, IOHK\u2019s chief scientist, this model makes it possible to issue a transaction that declares a liability denominated in ADA that\u2019s equal to the amount of fees that the transaction issuer is supposed to pay. This type of transaction is perceived as an open offer on the blockchain, asking interested parties to cover the liability. In return for covering the liability, the party would be paid a reward in the form of other tokens included in the transaction.</p><p>However, a transaction with a liability wouldn\u2019t be admissible to the blockchain by itself. Block producers are the ones tasked with creating a matching transaction that will absorb the liability, covering it both with ADA and the other tokens included in the transaction. As such, the transaction with the liability and its matching transaction become admissible to the ledger as a group.</p><h2>Stake pool operators become liquidity providers under Babel fees</h2><p>The only way for this mechanism to work is for the Cardano blockchain to introduce the notion of liquidity providers. These LPs are participants in the blockchain that are willing to issue matching transactions on the blockchain.</p><p>In the case of Babel fees, it\u2019s the stake pool operators that become the liquidity providers. They are incentivized by the market to provide exchange rates for specific native tokens they want to accept. Prof. Kiayias explained that any SPO can declare that they will accept a certain token for a fixed exchange rate, for example, 3:1 over ADA. If a transaction costs 0.16 ADA, the sender can declare a liability of 0.16 ADA and offer 0.48 of token X. Cardano\u2019s native asset model implements this as a single UTXO carrying a token bundle with the following specifications:</p><p><strong>ADA \u2192 -0.16, token X \u2192 0.48</strong></p><p>In the bundle, the liability is represented with a negative sign.</p><p>The stake pool operator that accepts the transaction recovers the liability from the mempool and issues a matching transaction consuming the UTXO with the liability. The matching transaction transfers 0.48 of token X to a new output, owned by the SPO.</p><p>What makes this rather simple mechanism revolutionary for blockchain technology is the fact that it\u2019s entirely op-in for SPOs. Each stake pool operator can determine their own policy and exchange rate irrespective of each other. This means that different stake pool operators can provide different exchange rates for the same token, pushing users issuing liability transactions to offer an amount of tokens that corresponds to the minimum, average, or even maximum of the posted exchange rates on the network.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIn this way, a natural trade-off arises between settlement time of liability transactions and the market value of tokens they offer,\u201d Kiayias explained in IOHK\u2019s blog post.</p></blockquote><p>To further promote the free market experience, Babel fees don\u2019t require SPOs to be the only entities on the network covering liabilities. Stake pool operators can partner with an external liquidity provider that will issue matching transactions. In addition to that, third-party providers can also independently on the network and issue matching transactions themselves, removing the need for stake pool operators.</p><p>Aside from Babel fees, this mechanism enables a variety of other innovative applications. While IOHK has remained mostly silent on the issue, its latest blog post highlighted atomic swaps for spot trades as one possible implementation of the mechanism.</p><p>According to Kiayias, the mechanism enabling negative quantities in token bundles will be implemented in the basic ledger rules of Cardano following the Mary Hard Fork. And while there\u2019s still no clear date as to when Babel fees will be enabled, it\u2019s safe to assume that they will see the light of day sometime shortly after the introduction of native assets.</p><div class=\"link-page\"></div><div class=\"posted-in\">Posted In: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/news/cardano/\" rel=\"tag\">Cardano</a>, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/altcoins/\"

Danielsson claims the concept of Bitcoin as money makes no sense. What\u2019s more, should it ever succeed, he envisions a world of great inequality which, as he alludes to, is contrary to its egalitarian principle.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cFortunately, the more successful bitcoin becomes, the more visible the perverse consequences and the internal contradictions become, so that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be discarded long before we get to that point. At which time, the price of bitcoin will head to zero.\u201d</p></blockquote><h2>Bitcoin continues to court controversy</h2><p>A record-breaking month saw Bitcoin hit $58k for the first time in its history. Although a dip this week sent jitters across the market, it\u2019s important to note that the fundamentals remain sound.</p><p>If anything, they grow stronger, as evidenced by the flurry of institutional interest over the past couple of weeks. And more recently, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/here-are-the-interesting-tidbits-from-coinbases-ipo-filing/\">Coinbase\u2019s S-1</a> filing, which many predict will bring an element of legitimacy to cryptocurrency.</p><p>Nonetheless, despite its achievements, it\u2019s fair to say that Bitcoin still attracts its share of hate and skepticism. Perhaps to a lesser extent now, having near tripled in value since December.</p><p>People who had previously dismissed it as a nothing burger fall into two camps. Those who are re-assessing and receptive to learning more and those who cling to outdated ideas and principles by doubling down on their skepticism.</p><p>Danielsson falls into the latter camp. Like many economists who examine Bitcoin, Danielsson views the leading cryptocurrency through an \u201cold-world\u201d lens. In doing so, several fundamental principles get overlooked.</p><p>For example, comparing on-demand money (M1) to Bitcoin has no basis. Few retailers accept Bitcoin directly because it\u2019s too slow and expensive to transact with. However, service providers such as <a href=\"https://bitpay.com/card\">BitPay</a> offer an intermediary service to convert crypto to fiat at the point of sale.</p><p>Its inefficiencies as a medium of exchange should not detract from its overall value. Just as retailers do not accept gold, it makes no sense to then say gold will go to zero on that basis.</p><h2>Woeful outlook</h2><p>Danielsson paints a hypothetical situation in which Bitcoin succeeds in eating the market cap of all world assets, fuelling an even greater split between the haves and have-nots.</p><p>No reply can satisfactorily respond to that scenario. However, in such a situation, the world would be a very different place, and Bitcoin should not be held responsible for those who refuse to adapt to change.</p><p>Bitcoin is a nascent technology that doesn\u2019t fit neatly into classical definitions of money per economic theory. As a decentralized and permissionless network, its undertaking is far more significant than merely exchanging value, as is the case with money.</p><p>Perhaps the bigger question at play is, why is the demand for Bitcoin skyrocketing? Answering that question will give insight into how people feel about the status quo.</p><div class=\"link-page\"></div><div class=\"posted-in\">Posted In: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/news/bitcoin/\" rel=\"tag\">Bitcoin</a>, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/adoption/\" rel=\"category tag\">Adoption</a></div><div class=\"post-cta\"><h3>Like what you see? <span>Subscribe for daily updates.</span></h3> <iframe src=\"https://cryptoslate.substack.com/embed\" width=\"500\" height=\"120\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div><div class=\"cpa-signup cryptocom placement clearfix\"> <a href=\"http://bit.ly/CS-CryptoComReferral\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Sign up for Crypto.com Metal Visa Card and get $50 USD&lt;\"> <span class=\"icon\"></span><h3>Sign up for a Crypto.com Metal Visa Card and get $50 USD</h3> <span class=\"cta-btn\">Sign up</span> </a></div><div class=\"top footer-disclaimer\"><p><strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

The proceeds from the sell-off will be used to purchase Cardano and Polkadot, as the fund\u2019s managing director says he believes ADA, DOT, and ETH will be the foundation of Web 3.0.</p><h2>Cardano and Polkadot get backing from a major crypto fund</h2><p>The crypto industry has been ripe with news of major financial institutions and enterprises acquiring huge amounts of Bitcoin. From Jack Dorsey\u2019s <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/square-allocates-one-percent-of-its-total-assets-to-bitcoin/\">Square</a> leading the pack with its massive BTC purchases last year and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-shortage-paypal-bought-70-of-all-mined-btc-last-month/\">PayPal\u2019s</a> and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/visa-aiming-mass-adoption-with-crypto-pilot-scheme-for-banks/\">Visa\u2019s</a> crypto payment functionality to <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/microstrategy-buys-another-1-billion-worth-of-bitcoin/\">MicroStrategy\u2019s</a> and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/tesla-made-more-money-buying-btc-in-one-day-than-it-did-selling-cars-last-quarter/\">Tesla\u2019s</a> billion-dollar acquisitions\u2014there seems to be a corporate race to accumulate Bitcoin.</p><p>However, a major cryptocurrency fund in Dubai has decided to go a different route and sell-off most of its Bitcoin holdings. FD7, a global crypto investment fund with $1 billion in assets under management (AUM), announced that it plans on selling $750 million of its <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/\">BTC</a> holdings in the next month.</p><p>According to the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210225005902/en/Global-Crypto-Investment-Fund-FD7-Ventures-to-Sell-750M-USD-Worth-of-Bitcoin-to-Increase-Cardano-and-Polkadot-Holdings\">press release</a>, the proceeds from the sell-off will be used to increase the company\u2019s positions in <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/cardano/\">Cardano</a> (ADA) and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/polkadot/\">Polkadot</a> (DOT). The increase in DOT and ADA holdings will better serve the needs of FD7 investors, the company explained in the release.</p><h2>The fund\u2019s managing director deems Bitcoin \u201cuseless\u201d as a store of value</h2><p>Prakash Chand, the managing director at FD7 Ventures, said that the fund\u2019s investors want to diversify their portfolios in the crypto space.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAside from the fact that Bitcoin was first to market and society has given it meaning as a store of value, I think Bitcoin is actually pretty useless,\u201d he said in the company\u2019s press release. \u201cProjects such as Cardano, Polkadot, and Ethereum are the foundation of the new internet and Web 3.0.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>And it\u2019s not just portfolio diversification that pushed the fund to Cardano and Polkadot. The company said that both the founder of Cardano, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/charles-hoskinson/\">Charles Hoskinson</a>, and the founder of Polkadot, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/gavin-wood/\">Dr. Gavin Wood</a>, are considered to be \u201ctwo of the brightest minds\u201d working in crypto. Both, the company further explained, lead projects it believes will have the potential for significant worldwide impact. Chand noted that he was convinced <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/\">Ethereum</a>, Cardano, and Polkadot will be more valuable than Bitcoin within the next few years, which is why the company was trying to front-run the market and expose their investors to the growing assets.</p><div class=\"link-page\"></div><div class=\"posted-in\">Posted In: <a

The significant growth in new addresses on the network was partly fueled by the upgrade to Daedalus which will introduce native-asset support to the wallet.</p><h2>The Cardano network sees significant expansion ahead of native asset upgrade</h2><p>With the clock counting down the final hours before the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/todays-mary-hard-fork-will-bring-cardano-one-step-closer-to-goguen/\">Mary hard fork</a>, the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/cardano/\">Cardano</a> network reached two major milestones that are set to propel the network to the top of the industry.</p><p>IOHK, the company behind Cardano, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1366157590602932225\">announced</a> today that it has released the first version of the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/products/daedalus/\">Daedalus</a> wallet with multi-asset support. According to the company\u2019s release, the Daedalus v. 4.0.0-RC1 was released to the Cardano public testnet on Mar. 1.</p><p>Later in the day, the company is set to release a Daedalus Flight wallet timed with the Mary Hard Fork Combinator (HFC) event. The rest of the market, however, will have to wait a bit before the full version of Daedalus is released. IOHK said that the wallet will be fully released after final user experience testing with the Flight community and any last-minute UI tweaks.</p><p>Daedalus is the most popular Cardano wallet. The current version will enable developers and stake pool operators (SPOs) to test sending and receiving native tokens alongside ADA. Once the wallet is fully released, it will also feature a brand new interface and UI.</p><h2>Half a million unique wallet addresses on Cardano await for Mary</h2><p>Just as IOHK announced the latest version of Daedalus, the Cardano network crossed another major milestone. While it\u2019s hard to pinpoint a single factor that contributed to the massive rise in users on the blockchain, the upcoming Mary hard fork and increased functionality of the network could be the ones to blame.</p><p><a href=\"https://adastat.net/\">According to</a> the latest data from AdaStat, there are currently 506,538 total unique wallet addresses on the Cardano network. With 294,682 delegators, this means that over 58 percent of all of the addresses on the Cardano blockchain have their funds staked to support the network.</p><p>Further data from AdaPools and AdaStat showed that the average amount of ADA per delegated wallets has been steadily decreasing this year, further strengthening Cardano\u2019s decentralization and distributing power to a large number of network participants.</p><figure style=\"width: 803px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

This makes it the third biggest Grayscale trust after the Bitcoin Trust with <a href=\"https://grayscale.co/bitcoin-trust/\">$31.2bn</a> AUM and the Ethereum Trust with <a href=\"https://grayscale.co/ethereum-trust/\">$4.7bn</a> AUM.</p><h2>The benefits of investing in Grayscale</h2><p>Grayscale is a regulated investment company, registering its shares with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It operates several single asset and multi-asset cryptocurrency trusts, which are the first digital currency investment vehicles to obtain the SEC\u2019s approval.</p><p>The trusts allow accredited investors, usually institutions and high net worth individuals, exposure to cryptocurrency through buying and selling of its publicly traded shares.</p><p>Investors trade these shares on the <a href=\"https://www.otcmarkets.com/index.html\">OTCQX</a>, which is an over-the-counter market operating under Alternative Reporting Standards. This means they are not required to register with the SEC.</p><p>Buying shares in a Grayscale trust versus buying crypto directly is advantageous because it allows for hassle-free exposure to cryptocurrency. Particularly concerning the safe storage and custody of crypto assets.</p><p>There is also the added benefit of more explicit tax rules concerning shares, meaning investors can hold them in particular tax-advantaged accounts, such as a Roth IRA.</p><h2>There\u2019s a price to pay for investing in the Grayscale Litecoin Trust</h2><p>But this comes at a price. First, Grayscale charges an <a href=\"https://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Grayscale-One-Pager-February-2021.pdf\">annual fee</a>, varying between 2% to 3%, depending on the trust. The Litecoin Trust charges an annual fee of 2.5%.</p><p>There\u2019s also the issue of \u201cpremium,\u201d which refers to the difference between the value of the holdings of the trust vs. the market price of the holdings. Grayscale\u2019s current Litecoin per-share value is 0.09276776, and with a current LTC price of $175, this means each Grayscale Litecoin Trust share (LTCN) is equivalent to $15.75 of Litecoin. But the current price of LTCN is $319.</p><p>That equates to a premium of over 1,900% \u2013 a staggering difference to pay versus direct exposure.</p><p>Nonetheless, news of Grayscale buying significant quantities of Litecoin suggests that this does not phase institutional investors.</p><p>The response to Grayscale buys and (potential) listings have earned the firm a reputation as a bullish market mover. Rumors of a Chainlink Trust triggered a <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/new-grayscale-trust-filings-spin-rumour-mill-into-overdrive-for-cardano-polkadot-cosmos-and-more/\">20%</a> breakout for LINK at the end of January.</p><p>Since Litecoin announced the Grayscale buy, the price of LTC made a $10 swing to close yesterday up 6%. Commenting on the relatively modest increase, Litecoin <a href=\"https://twitter.com/litecoin/status/1366620971185102849\">tweeted</a> that OTC orders do not immediately impact the market.</p><div

And while this might seem like a huge technical conundrum, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/companies/input-output-iohk/\">IOHK</a>\u2019s engineers have actually come up with a rather simple, free-market-oriented solution.</p><h2>Cardano\u2019s Extended UTXO makes native token transactions possible</h2><p>Aside from opening up the world of DeFi to its users, the addition of <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/how-cardano-will-handle-native-tokens-on-its-platform/\">native tokens</a> to the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/cardano/\">Cardano</a> blockchain comes with a whole new set of technological benefits. The biggest advancement made possible by native tokens is Babel fees, a mechanism that enables users to pay transaction fees on the blockchain with user-defined tokens, rather than just using the blockchain\u2019s native token.</p><p>In practice, this means that any token issued on Cardano can be used to pay transaction fees, a move that will enable users to completely circumvent the use of ADA.</p><p>This is made possible by Cardano Extended<a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/cardano-parent-iohk-partners-with-nervos-to-improve-smart-contract-security/\"> UTXO</a> (EUTXO) model. Unlike <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/\">Ethereum</a>\u2019s account-based model, issuing a valid transaction on Cardano requires consuming one or more UTXOs. However, a UTXO on Cardano is able to carry a bundle that contains multiple different tokens, both fungible and non-fungible.</p><p>According to a <a href=\"https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/25/babel-fees/\">blog post</a> by Prof. Aggelos Kiayias, IOHK\u2019s chief scientist, this model makes it possible to issue a transaction that declares a liability denominated in ADA that\u2019s equal to the amount of fees that the transaction issuer is supposed to pay. This type of transaction is perceived as an open offer on the blockchain, asking interested parties to cover the liability. In return for covering the liability, the party would be paid a reward in the form of other tokens included in the transaction.</p><p>However, a transaction with a liability wouldn\u2019t be admissible to the blockchain by itself. Block producers are the ones tasked with creating a matching transaction that will absorb the liability, covering it both with ADA and the other tokens included in the transaction. As such, the transaction with the liability and its matching transaction become admissible to the ledger as a group.</p><h2>Stake pool operators become liquidity providers under Babel fees</h2><p>The only way for this mechanism to work is for the Cardano blockchain to introduce the notion of liquidity providers. These LPs are participants in the blockchain that are willing to issue matching transactions on the blockchain.</p><p>In the case of Babel fees, it\u2019s the stake pool operators that become the liquidity providers. They are incentivized by the market to provide exchange rates for specific native tokens they want to accept. Prof. Kiayias explained that any SPO can declare that they will accept a certain token for a fixed exchange rate, for example, 3:1 over ADA. If a transaction costs 0.16 ADA, the sender can declare a liability of 0.16 ADA and offer 0.48 of token X. Cardano\u2019s native asset model implements this as a single UTXO carrying a token bundle with the following specifications:</p><p><strong>ADA \u2192 -0.16, token X \u2192 0.48</strong></p><p>In the bundle, the liability is represented with a negative sign.</p><p>The stake pool operator that accepts the transaction recovers the liability from the mempool and issues a matching transaction consuming the UTXO with the liability. The matching transaction transfers 0.48 of token X to a new output, owned by the SPO.</p><p>What makes this rather simple mechanism revolutionary for blockchain technology is the fact that it\u2019s entirely op-in for SPOs. Each stake pool operator can determine their own policy and exchange rate irrespective of each other. This means that different stake pool operators can provide different exchange rates for the same token, pushing users issuing liability transactions to offer an amount of tokens that corresponds to the minimum, average, or even maximum of the posted exchange rates on the network.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIn this way, a natural trade-off arises between settlement time of liability transactions and the market value of tokens they offer,\u201d Kiayias explained in IOHK\u2019s blog post.</p></blockquote><p>To further promote the free market experience, Babel fees don\u2019t require SPOs to be the only entities on the network covering liabilities. Stake pool operators can partner with an external liquidity provider that will issue matching transactions. In addition to that, third-party providers can also independently on the network and issue matching transactions themselves, removing the need for stake pool operators.</p><p>Aside from Babel fees, this mechanism enables a variety of other innovative applications. While IOHK has remained mostly silent on the issue, its latest blog post highlighted atomic swaps for spot trades as one possible implementation of the mechanism.</p><p>According to Kiayias, the mechanism enabling negative quantities in token bundles will be implemented in the basic ledger rules of Cardano following the Mary Hard Fork. And while there\u2019s still no clear date as to when Babel fees will be enabled, it\u2019s safe to assume that they will see the light of day sometime shortly after the introduction of native assets.</p><div class=\"link-page\"></div><div class=\"posted-in\">Posted In: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/news/cardano/\" rel=\"tag\">Cardano</a>, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/altcoins/\"

Each interaction on the network is validated by a miner, an entity that uses its resources to maintain the network and earn rewards in return. The user includes a \u201cgas\u201d fee for miners who may choose to take the offer up, process the transaction, and pocket the fees.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means all bids are temporarily flashed on blockchain for everyone to see.

They basically flashed a transaction to the network\u2014and in the same transaction\u2014got filled by someone else who accepted the bid, added a bit more (via a flash loan on Aave), and pocketed the deal.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTo clarify, bids could always snipe with slightly higher bids, that\u2019s not the issue. The problem is that the contract doesn\u2019t collect the entire bid amount for the seller if that eth is removed (back to AAVE here) in the same transaction,\u201d explained Arad in a separate tweet.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, as unjust as the above sounds, the method was not illegal in any way (ill-intended, but not illegal).

The announcement garnered a mixed response. Some praised the unconventional approach to municipal budgeting. Others blasted the idea by regurgitating FUD, including accusations of it being a Ponzi scheme and its failings as a currency.</p><p>Nonetheless, Suarez has pushed ahead with plans to integrate Bitcoin into Miami life. In February, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/miami-mayor-pushes-crypto-with-offer-to-pay-workers-in-bitcoin\">he</a> proposed paying city workers and collecting taxes in Bitcoin.</p><p>The city\u2019s commission approved the proposal in a 4-1 result.

It\u2019s an extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions, and the amount of energy that\u2019s consumed in processing those transactions is staggering.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>She also

Danielsson claims the concept of Bitcoin as money makes no sense. What\u2019s more, should it ever succeed, he envisions a world of great inequality which, as he alludes to, is contrary to its egalitarian principle.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cFortunately, the more successful bitcoin becomes, the more visible the perverse consequences and the internal contradictions become, so that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be discarded long before we get to that point. At which time, the price of bitcoin will head to zero.\u201d</p></blockquote><h2>Bitcoin continues to court controversy</h2><p>A record-breaking month saw Bitcoin hit $58k for the first time in its history. Although a dip this week sent jitters across the market, it\u2019s important to note that the fundamentals remain sound.</p><p>If anything, they grow stronger, as evidenced by the flurry of institutional interest over the past couple of weeks. And more recently, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/here-are-the-interesting-tidbits-from-coinbases-ipo-filing/\">Coinbase\u2019s S-1</a> filing, which many predict will bring an element of legitimacy to cryptocurrency.</p><p>Nonetheless, despite its achievements, it\u2019s fair to say that Bitcoin still attracts its share of hate and skepticism. Perhaps to a lesser extent now, having near tripled in value since December.</p><p>People who had previously dismissed it as a nothing burger fall into two camps. Those who are re-assessing and receptive to learning more and those who cling to outdated ideas and principles by doubling down on their skepticism.</p><p>Danielsson falls into the latter camp. Like many economists who examine Bitcoin, Danielsson views the leading cryptocurrency through an \u201cold-world\u201d lens. In doing so, several fundamental principles get overlooked.</p><p>For example, comparing on-demand money (M1) to Bitcoin has no basis. Few retailers accept Bitcoin directly because it\u2019s too slow and expensive to transact with. However, service providers such as <a href=\"https://bitpay.com/card\">BitPay</a> offer an intermediary service to convert crypto to fiat at the point of sale.</p><p>Its inefficiencies as a medium of exchange should not detract from its overall value. Just as retailers do not accept gold, it makes no sense to then say gold will go to zero on that basis.</p><h2>Woeful outlook</h2><p>Danielsson paints a hypothetical situation in which Bitcoin succeeds in eating the market cap of all world assets, fuelling an even greater split between the haves and have-nots.</p><p>No reply can satisfactorily respond to that scenario. However, in such a situation, the world would be a very different place, and Bitcoin should not be held responsible for those who refuse to adapt to change.</p><p>Bitcoin is a nascent technology that doesn\u2019t fit neatly into classical definitions of money per economic theory. As a decentralized and permissionless network, its undertaking is far more significant than merely exchanging value, as is the case with money.</p><p>Perhaps the bigger question at play is, why is the demand for Bitcoin skyrocketing? Answering that question will give insight into how people feel about the status quo.</p><div class=\"link-page\"></div><div class=\"posted-in\">Posted In: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/news/bitcoin/\" rel=\"tag\">Bitcoin</a>, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/adoption/\" rel=\"category tag\">Adoption</a></div><div class=\"post-cta\"><h3>Like what you see? <span>Subscribe for daily updates.</span></h3> <iframe src=\"https://cryptoslate.substack.com/embed\" width=\"500\" height=\"120\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div><div class=\"cpa-signup cryptocom placement clearfix\"> <a href=\"http://bit.ly/CS-CryptoComReferral\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Sign up for Crypto.com Metal Visa Card and get $50 USD&lt;\"> <span class=\"icon\"></span><h3>Sign up for a Crypto.com Metal Visa Card and get $50 USD</h3> <span class=\"cta-btn\">Sign up</span> </a></div><div class=\"top footer-disclaimer\"><p><strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

The proceeds from the sell-off will be used to purchase Cardano and Polkadot, as the fund\u2019s managing director says he believes ADA, DOT, and ETH will be the foundation of Web 3.0.</p><h2>Cardano and Polkadot get backing from a major crypto fund</h2><p>The crypto industry has been ripe with news of major financial institutions and enterprises acquiring huge amounts of Bitcoin. From Jack Dorsey\u2019s <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/square-allocates-one-percent-of-its-total-assets-to-bitcoin/\">Square</a> leading the pack with its massive BTC purchases last year and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-shortage-paypal-bought-70-of-all-mined-btc-last-month/\">PayPal\u2019s</a> and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/visa-aiming-mass-adoption-with-crypto-pilot-scheme-for-banks/\">Visa\u2019s</a> crypto payment functionality to <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/microstrategy-buys-another-1-billion-worth-of-bitcoin/\">MicroStrategy\u2019s</a> and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/tesla-made-more-money-buying-btc-in-one-day-than-it-did-selling-cars-last-quarter/\">Tesla\u2019s</a> billion-dollar acquisitions\u2014there seems to be a corporate race to accumulate Bitcoin.</p><p>However, a major cryptocurrency fund in Dubai has decided to go a different route and sell-off most of its Bitcoin holdings. FD7, a global crypto investment fund with $1 billion in assets under management (AUM), announced that it plans on selling $750 million of its <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/\">BTC</a> holdings in the next month.</p><p>According to the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210225005902/en/Global-Crypto-Investment-Fund-FD7-Ventures-to-Sell-750M-USD-Worth-of-Bitcoin-to-Increase-Cardano-and-Polkadot-Holdings\">press release</a>, the proceeds from the sell-off will be used to increase the company\u2019s positions in <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/cardano/\">Cardano</a> (ADA) and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/polkadot/\">Polkadot</a> (DOT). The increase in DOT and ADA holdings will better serve the needs of FD7 investors, the company explained in the release.</p><h2>The fund\u2019s managing director deems Bitcoin \u201cuseless\u201d as a store of value</h2><p>Prakash Chand, the managing director at FD7 Ventures, said that the fund\u2019s investors want to diversify their portfolios in the crypto space.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAside from the fact that Bitcoin was first to market and society has given it meaning as a store of value, I think Bitcoin is actually pretty useless,\u201d he said in the company\u2019s press release. \u201cProjects such as Cardano, Polkadot, and Ethereum are the foundation of the new internet and Web 3.0.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>And it\u2019s not just portfolio diversification that pushed the fund to Cardano and Polkadot. The company said that both the founder of Cardano, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/charles-hoskinson/\">Charles Hoskinson</a>, and the founder of Polkadot, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/gavin-wood/\">Dr. Gavin Wood</a>, are considered to be \u201ctwo of the brightest minds\u201d working in crypto. Both, the company further explained, lead projects it believes will have the potential for significant worldwide impact. Chand noted that he was convinced <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/\">Ethereum</a>, Cardano, and Polkadot will be more valuable than Bitcoin within the next few years, which is why the company was trying to front-run the market and expose their investors to the growing assets.</p><div class=\"link-page\"></div><div class=\"posted-in\">Posted In: <a

The significant growth in new addresses on the network was partly fueled by the upgrade to Daedalus which will introduce native-asset support to the wallet.</p><h2>The Cardano network sees significant expansion ahead of native asset upgrade</h2><p>With the clock counting down the final hours before the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/todays-mary-hard-fork-will-bring-cardano-one-step-closer-to-goguen/\">Mary hard fork</a>, the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/cardano/\">Cardano</a> network reached two major milestones that are set to propel the network to the top of the industry.</p><p>IOHK, the company behind Cardano, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1366157590602932225\">announced</a> today that it has released the first version of the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/products/daedalus/\">Daedalus</a> wallet with multi-asset support. According to the company\u2019s release, the Daedalus v. 4.0.0-RC1 was released to the Cardano public testnet on Mar. 1.</p><p>Later in the day, the company is set to release a Daedalus Flight wallet timed with the Mary Hard Fork Combinator (HFC) event. The rest of the market, however, will have to wait a bit before the full version of Daedalus is released. IOHK said that the wallet will be fully released after final user experience testing with the Flight community and any last-minute UI tweaks.</p><p>Daedalus is the most popular Cardano wallet. The current version will enable developers and stake pool operators (SPOs) to test sending and receiving native tokens alongside ADA. Once the wallet is fully released, it will also feature a brand new interface and UI.</p><h2>Half a million unique wallet addresses on Cardano await for Mary</h2><p>Just as IOHK announced the latest version of Daedalus, the Cardano network crossed another major milestone. While it\u2019s hard to pinpoint a single factor that contributed to the massive rise in users on the blockchain, the upcoming Mary hard fork and increased functionality of the network could be the ones to blame.</p><p><a href=\"https://adastat.net/\">According to</a> the latest data from AdaStat, there are currently 506,538 total unique wallet addresses on the Cardano network. With 294,682 delegators, this means that over 58 percent of all of the addresses on the Cardano blockchain have their funds staked to support the network.</p><p>Further data from AdaPools and AdaStat showed that the average amount of ADA per delegated wallets has been steadily decreasing this year, further strengthening Cardano\u2019s decentralization and distributing power to a large number of

This makes it the third biggest Grayscale trust after the Bitcoin Trust with <a href=\"https://grayscale.co/bitcoin-trust/\">$31.2bn</a> AUM and the Ethereum Trust with <a href=\"https://grayscale.co/ethereum-trust/\">$4.7bn</a> AUM.</p><h2>The benefits of investing in Grayscale</h2><p>Grayscale is a regulated investment company, registering its shares with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It operates several single asset and multi-asset cryptocurrency trusts, which are the first digital currency investment vehicles to obtain the SEC\u2019s approval.</p><p>The trusts allow accredited investors, usually institutions and high net worth individuals, exposure to cryptocurrency through buying and selling of its publicly traded shares.</p><p>Investors trade these shares on the <a href=\"https://www.otcmarkets.com/index.html\">OTCQX</a>, which is an over-the-counter market operating under Alternative Reporting Standards. This means they are not required to register with the SEC.</p><p>Buying shares in a Grayscale trust versus buying crypto directly is advantageous because it allows for hassle-free exposure to cryptocurrency. Particularly concerning the safe storage and custody of crypto assets.</p><p>There is also the added benefit of more explicit tax rules concerning shares, meaning investors can hold them in particular tax-advantaged accounts, such as a Roth IRA.</p><h2>There\u2019s a price to pay for investing in the Grayscale Litecoin Trust</h2><p>But this comes at a price. First, Grayscale charges an <a href=\"https://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Grayscale-One-Pager-February-2021.pdf\">annual fee</a>, varying between 2% to 3%, depending on the trust. The Litecoin Trust charges an annual fee of 2.5%.</p><p>There\u2019s also the issue of \u201cpremium,\u201d which refers to the difference between the value of the holdings of the trust vs. the market price of the holdings. Grayscale\u2019s current Litecoin per-share value is 0.09276776, and with a current LTC price of $175, this means each Grayscale Litecoin Trust share (LTCN) is equivalent to $15.75 of Litecoin. But the current price of LTCN is $319.</p><p>That equates to a premium of over 1,900% \u2013 a staggering difference to pay versus direct exposure.</p><p>Nonetheless, news of Grayscale buying significant quantities of Litecoin suggests that this does not phase institutional investors.</p><p>The response to Grayscale buys and (potential) listings have earned the firm a reputation as a bullish market mover. Rumors of a Chainlink Trust triggered a <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/new-grayscale-trust-filings-spin-rumour-mill-into-overdrive-for-cardano-polkadot-cosmos-and-more/\">20%</a> breakout for LINK at the end of January.</p><p>Since Litecoin announced the Grayscale buy, the price of LTC made a $10 swing to close yesterday up 6%. Commenting on the relatively modest increase, Litecoin <a href=\"https://twitter.com/litecoin/status/1366620971185102849\">tweeted</a> that OTC orders do not immediately impact the market.</p><div

Each interaction on the network is validated by a miner, an entity that uses its resources to maintain the network and earn rewards in return. The user includes a \u201cgas\u201d fee for miners who may choose to take the offer up, process the transaction, and pocket the fees.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means all bids are temporarily flashed on blockchain for everyone to see. It also means it opens up possibilities for predatory miners or traders to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">front-run</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the bid and pocket a better deal.</span></p><h2><b>CryptoPunks front run</b></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such a situation resulted in the seller of Punk #1737 being front run by another trader/miner and losing out on the deal. They basically flashed a transaction to the network\u2014and in the same transaction\u2014got filled by someone else who accepted the bid, added a bit more (via a flash loan on Aave), and pocketed the deal.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTo clarify, bids could always snipe with slightly higher bids, that\u2019s not the issue. The problem is that the contract doesn\u2019t collect the entire bid amount for the seller if that eth is removed (back to AAVE here) in the same transaction,\u201d explained Arad in a separate tweet.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, as unjust as the above sounds, the method was not illegal in any way (ill-intended, but not illegal). The CryptoPunks protocol itself has not been damaged or affected, and neither is there a problem with Ethereum.</span></p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There is nothing to be stressed about.

And while this might seem like a huge technical conundrum, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/companies/input-output-iohk/\">IOHK</a>\u2019s engineers have actually come up with a rather simple, free-market-oriented solution.</p><h2>Cardano\u2019s Extended UTXO makes native token transactions possible</h2><p>Aside from opening up the world of DeFi to its users, the addition of <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/how-cardano-will-handle-native-tokens-on-its-platform/\">native tokens</a> to the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/cardano/\">Cardano</a> blockchain comes with a whole new set of technological benefits. The biggest advancement made possible by native tokens is Babel fees, a mechanism that enables users to pay transaction fees on the blockchain with user-defined tokens, rather than just using the blockchain\u2019s native token.</p><p>In practice, this means that any token issued on Cardano can be used to pay transaction fees, a move that will enable users to completely circumvent the use of ADA.</p><p>This is made possible by Cardano Extended<a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/cardano-parent-iohk-partners-with-nervos-to-improve-smart-contract-security/\"> UTXO</a> (EUTXO) model. Unlike <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/\">Ethereum</a>\u2019s account-based model, issuing a valid transaction on Cardano requires consuming one or more UTXOs. However, a UTXO on Cardano is able to carry a bundle that contains multiple different tokens, both fungible and non-fungible.</p><p>According to a <a href=\"https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/25/babel-fees/\">blog post</a> by Prof. Aggelos Kiayias, IOHK\u2019s chief scientist, this model makes it possible to issue a transaction that declares a liability denominated in ADA that\u2019s equal to the amount of fees that the transaction issuer is supposed to pay. This type of transaction is perceived as an open offer on the blockchain, asking interested parties to cover the liability. In return for covering the liability, the party would be paid a reward in the form of other tokens included in the transaction.</p><p>However, a transaction with a liability wouldn\u2019t be admissible to the blockchain by itself. Block producers are the ones tasked with creating a matching transaction that will absorb the liability, covering it both with ADA and the other tokens included in the transaction. As such, the transaction with the liability and its matching transaction become admissible to the ledger as a group.</p><h2>Stake pool operators become liquidity providers under Babel fees</h2><p>The only way for this mechanism to work is for the Cardano blockchain to introduce the notion of liquidity providers. These LPs are participants in the blockchain that are willing to issue matching transactions on the blockchain.</p><p>In the case of Babel fees, it\u2019s the stake pool operators that become the liquidity providers. They are incentivized by the market to provide exchange rates for specific native tokens they want to accept. Prof. Kiayias explained that any SPO can declare that they will accept a certain token for a fixed exchange rate, for example, 3:1 over ADA. If a transaction costs 0.16 ADA, the sender can declare a liability of 0.16 ADA and offer 0.48 of token X. Cardano\u2019s native asset model implements this as a single UTXO carrying a token bundle with the following specifications:</p><p><strong>ADA \u2192 -0.16, token X \u2192 0.48</strong></p><p>In the bundle, the liability is represented with a negative sign.</p><p>The stake pool operator that accepts the transaction recovers the liability from the mempool and issues a matching transaction consuming the UTXO with the liability. The matching transaction transfers 0.48 of token X to a new output, owned by the SPO.</p><p>What makes this rather simple mechanism revolutionary for blockchain technology is the fact that it\u2019s entirely op-in for SPOs. Each stake pool operator can determine their own policy and exchange rate irrespective of each other. This means that different stake pool operators can provide different exchange rates for the same token, pushing users issuing liability transactions to offer an amount of tokens that corresponds to the minimum, average, or even maximum of the posted exchange rates on the network.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIn this way, a natural trade-off arises between settlement time of liability transactions and the market value of tokens they offer,\u201d Kiayias explained in IOHK\u2019s blog post.</p></blockquote><p>To further promote the free market experience, Babel fees don\u2019t require SPOs to be the only entities on the network covering liabilities. Stake pool operators can partner with an external liquidity provider that will issue matching transactions. In addition to that, third-party providers can also independently on the network and issue matching transactions themselves, removing the need for stake pool operators.</p><p>Aside from Babel fees, this mechanism enables a variety of other innovative applications. While IOHK has remained mostly silent on the issue, its latest blog post highlighted atomic swaps for spot trades as one possible implementation of the mechanism.</p><p>According to Kiayias, the mechanism enabling negative quantities in token bundles will be implemented in the basic ledger rules of Cardano following the Mary Hard Fork. And while there\u2019s still no clear date as to when Babel fees will be enabled, it\u2019s safe to assume that they will see the light of day sometime shortly after the introduction of native assets.</p><div class=\"link-page\"></div><div class=\"posted-in\">Posted In: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/news/cardano/\" rel=\"tag\">Cardano</a>, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/altcoins/\"

And when asked about his apparent tolerance for high-risk, Suarez replied by saying all investments are risky.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me at all the Treasury Secretary would find a decentralized potential currency to be hostile to a currency they control.</p><p>For people who invest in Bitcoin, the lure is precisely that it\u2019s not backed by a central government.

The announcement garnered a mixed response. Some praised the unconventional approach to municipal budgeting. Others blasted the idea by regurgitating FUD, including accusations of it being a Ponzi scheme and its failings as a currency.</p><p>Nonetheless, Suarez has pushed ahead with plans to integrate Bitcoin into Miami life. In February, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/miami-mayor-pushes-crypto-with-offer-to-pay-workers-in-bitcoin\">he</a> proposed paying city workers and collecting taxes in Bitcoin.</p><p>The city\u2019s commission approved the proposal in a 4-1 result. But only after downgrading the original plan to a study into the practicality of doing so.</p><p>Commissioner Manolo Reyes voiced caution, saying we need more information before jumping in. However, he remains committed to the study and open to finding out more.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cLet\u2019s analyze this before we jump in.

It\u2019s an extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions, and the amount of energy that\u2019s consumed in processing those transactions is staggering.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>She also

{"name_of_group": ["Bitcoin"], "main_url": ["https://cryptoslate.com/"], "name_of_subgroup": ["Adoption"], "title": ["Economist paints woeful outlook if Bitcoin were to ever succeed"], "date": ["2021-02-27T08:00:00"], "text": ["<article><p>London School of Economics teacher <a href=\"https://voxeu.org/article/what-happens-if-bitcoin-succeeds\">Jon Danielsson</a> argues that Bitcoin and fiat currency cannot co-exist. Danielsson claims the concept of Bitcoin as money makes no sense. What\u2019s more, should it ever succeed, he envisions a world of great inequality which, as he alludes to, is contrary to its egalitarian principle.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cFortunately, the more successful bitcoin becomes, the more visible the perverse consequences and the internal contradictions become, so that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be discarded long before we get to that point. At which time, the price of bitcoin will head to zero.\u201d</p></blockquote><h2>Bitcoin continues to court controversy</h2><p>A record-breaking month saw Bitcoin hit $58k for the first time in its history. Although a dip this week sent jitters across the market, it\u2019s important to note that the fundamentals remain sound.</p><p>If anything, they grow stronger, as evidenced by the flurry of institutional interest over the past couple of weeks. And more recently, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/here-are-the-interesting-tidbits-from-coinbases-ipo-filing/\">Coinbase\u2019s S-1</a> filing, which many predict will bring an element of legitimacy to cryptocurrency.</p><p>Nonetheless, despite its achievements, it\u2019s fair to say that Bitcoin still attracts its share of hate and skepticism. Perhaps to a lesser extent now, having near tripled in value since December.</p><p>People who had previously dismissed it as a nothing burger fall into two camps. Those who are re-assessing and receptive to learning more and those who cling to outdated ideas and principles by doubling down on their skepticism.</p><p>Danielsson falls into the latter camp. Like many economists who examine Bitcoin, Danielsson views the leading cryptocurrency through an \u201cold-world\u201d lens. In doing so, several fundamental principles get overlooked.</p><p>For example, comparing on-demand money (M1) to Bitcoin has no basis. Few retailers accept Bitcoin directly because it\u2019s too slow and expensive to transact with. However, service providers such as <a href=\"https://bitpay.com/card\">BitPay</a> offer an intermediary service to convert crypto to fiat at the point of sale.</p><p>Its inefficiencies as a medium of exchange should not detract from its overall value. Just as retailers do not accept gold, it makes no sense to then say gold will go to zero on that basis.</p><h2>Woeful outlook</h2><p>Danielsson paints a hypothetical situation in which Bitcoin succeeds in eating the market cap of all world assets, fuelling an even greater split between the haves and have-nots.</p><p>No reply can satisfactorily respond to that scenario. However, in such a situation, the world would be a very different place, and Bitcoin should not be held responsible for those who refuse to adapt to change.</p><p>Bitcoin is a nascent technology that doesn\u2019t fit neatly into classical definitions of money per economic theory. As a decentralized and permissionless network, its undertaking is far more significant than merely exchanging value, as is the case with money.</p><p>Perhaps the bigger question at play is, why is the demand for Bitcoin skyrocketing? Answering that question will give insight into how people feel about the status quo.</p><div class=\"link-page\"></div><div class=\"posted-in\">Posted In: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/news/bitcoin/\" rel=\"tag\">Bitcoin</a>, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/adoption/\" rel=\"category tag\">Adoption</a></div><div class=\"post-cta\"><h3>Like what you see? <span>Subscribe for daily updates.</span></h3> <iframe src=\"https://cryptoslate.substack.com/embed\" width=\"500\" height=\"120\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div><div class=\"cpa-signup cryptocom placement clearfix\"> <a href=\"http://bit.ly/CS-CryptoComReferral\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Sign up for Crypto.com Metal Visa Card and get $50 USD&lt;\"> <span class=\"icon\"></span><h3>Sign up for a Crypto.com Metal Visa Card and get $50 USD</h3> <span class=\"cta-btn\">Sign up</span> </a></div><div class=\"top footer-disclaimer\"><p><strong>Commitment to Transparency:</strong> The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

FD7, a global crypto investment fund with $1 billion in assets under management (AUM), announced that it plans on selling $750 million of its <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/\">BTC</a> holdings in the next month.</p><p>According to the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210225005902/en/Global-Crypto-Investment-Fund-FD7-Ventures-to-Sell-750M-USD-Worth-of-Bitcoin-to-Increase-Cardano-and-Polkadot-Holdings\">press release</a>, the proceeds from the sell-off will be used to increase the company\u2019s positions in <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/cardano/\">Cardano</a> (ADA) and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/polkadot/\">Polkadot</a> (DOT). The increase in DOT and ADA holdings will better serve the needs of FD7 investors, the company explained in the release.</p><h2>The fund\u2019s managing director deems Bitcoin \u201cuseless\u201d as a store of value</h2><p>Prakash Chand, the managing director at FD7 Ventures, said that the fund\u2019s investors want to diversify their portfolios in the crypto space.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAside from the fact that Bitcoin was first to market and society has given it meaning as a store of value, I think Bitcoin is actually pretty useless,\u201d he said in the company\u2019s press release. \u201cProjects such as Cardano, Polkadot, and Ethereum are the foundation of the new internet and Web 3.0.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>And it\u2019s not just portfolio diversification that pushed the fund to Cardano and Polkadot. The company said that both the founder of Cardano, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/charles-hoskinson/\">Charles Hoskinson</a>, and the founder of Polkadot, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/gavin-wood/\">Dr. Gavin Wood</a>, are considered to be \u201ctwo of the brightest minds\u201d working in crypto. Both, the company further explained, lead projects it believes will have the potential for significant worldwide impact. Chand noted that he was convinced <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/\">Ethereum</a>, Cardano, and Polkadot will be more valuable than Bitcoin within the next few years, which is why the

This makes it the third biggest Grayscale trust after the Bitcoin Trust with <a href=\"https://grayscale.co/bitcoin-trust/\">$31.2bn</a> AUM and the Ethereum Trust with <a href=\"https://grayscale.co/ethereum-trust/\">$4.7bn</a> AUM.</p><h2>The benefits of investing in Grayscale</h2><p>Grayscale is a regulated investment company, registering its shares with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It operates several single asset and multi-asset cryptocurrency trusts, which are the first digital currency investment vehicles to obtain the SEC\u2019s approval.</p><p>The trusts allow accredited investors, usually institutions and high net worth individuals, exposure to cryptocurrency through buying and selling of its publicly traded shares.</p><p>Investors trade these shares on the <a href=\"https://www.otcmarkets.com/index.html\">OTCQX</a>, which is an over-the-counter market operating under Alternative Reporting Standards. This means they are not required to register with the SEC.</p><p>Buying shares in a Grayscale trust versus buying crypto directly is advantageous because it allows for hassle-free exposure to cryptocurrency. Particularly concerning the safe storage and custody of crypto assets.</p><p>There is also the added benefit of more explicit tax rules concerning shares, meaning investors can hold them in particular tax-advantaged accounts, such as a Roth IRA.</p><h2>There\u2019s a price to pay for investing in the Grayscale Litecoin Trust</h2><p>But this comes at a price. First, Grayscale charges an <a href=\"https://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Grayscale-One-Pager-February-2021.pdf\">annual fee</a>, varying between 2% to 3%, depending on the trust. The Litecoin Trust charges an annual fee of 2.5%.</p><p>There\u2019s also the issue of \u201cpremium,\u201d which refers to the difference between the value of the holdings of the trust vs. the market price of the holdings. Grayscale\u2019s current Litecoin per-share value is 0.09276776, and with a current LTC price of $175, this means each Grayscale Litecoin Trust share (LTCN) is equivalent to $15.75 of Litecoin. But the current price of LTCN is $319.</p><p>That equates to a premium of over 1,900% \u2013 a staggering difference to pay versus direct exposure.</p><p>Nonetheless, news of Grayscale buying significant quantities of Litecoin suggests that this does not phase institutional investors.</p><p>The response to Grayscale buys and (potential) listings have earned the firm a reputation as a bullish market mover. Rumors of a Chainlink Trust triggered a <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/new-grayscale-trust-filings-spin-rumour-mill-into-overdrive-for-cardano-polkadot-cosmos-and-more/\">20%</a> breakout for LINK at the end of January.</p><p>Since Litecoin announced the Grayscale buy, the price of LTC made a $10 swing to close yesterday up 6%. Commenting on the relatively modest increase, Litecoin <a href=\"https://twitter.com/litecoin/status/1366620971185102849\">tweeted</a> that OTC orders do not immediately impact the market.</p><div

The significant growth in new addresses on the network was partly fueled by the upgrade to Daedalus which will introduce native-asset support to the wallet.</p><h2>The Cardano network sees significant expansion ahead of native asset upgrade</h2><p>With the clock counting down the final hours before the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/todays-mary-hard-fork-will-bring-cardano-one-step-closer-to-goguen/\">Mary hard fork</a>, the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/cardano/\">Cardano</a> network reached two major milestones that are set to propel the network to the top of the industry.</p><p>IOHK, the company behind Cardano, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1366157590602932225\">announced</a> today that it has released the first version of the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/products/daedalus/\">Daedalus</a> wallet with multi-asset support. According to the company\u2019s release, the Daedalus v. 4.0.0-RC1 was released to the Cardano public testnet on Mar. 1.</p><p>Later in the day, the company is set to release a Daedalus Flight wallet timed with the Mary Hard Fork Combinator (HFC) event. The rest of the market, however, will have to wait a bit before the full version of Daedalus is released. IOHK said that the wallet will be fully released after final user experience testing with the Flight community and any last-minute UI tweaks.</p><p>Daedalus is the most popular Cardano wallet. The current version will enable developers and stake pool operators (SPOs) to test sending and receiving native tokens alongside ADA. Once the wallet is fully released, it will also feature a brand new interface and UI.</p><h2>Half a million unique wallet addresses on Cardano await for Mary</h2><p>Just as IOHK announced the latest version of Daedalus, the Cardano network crossed another major milestone. While it\u2019s hard to pinpoint a single factor that contributed to the massive rise in users on the blockchain, the upcoming Mary hard fork and increased functionality of the network could be the ones to blame.</p><p><a href=\"https://adastat.net/\">According to</a> the latest data from AdaStat, there are currently 506,538 total unique wallet addresses on the Cardano network. With 294,682 delegators, this means that over 58 percent of all of the addresses on the Cardano blockchain have their funds staked to support the network.</p><p>Further data from AdaPools and AdaStat showed that the average amount of ADA per delegated wallets has been steadily decreasing this year, further strengthening Cardano\u2019s decentralization and distributing power to a large number of network participants.</p><figure style=\"width: 803px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

The announcement garnered a mixed response. Some praised the unconventional approach to municipal budgeting. Others blasted the idea by regurgitating FUD, including accusations of it being a Ponzi scheme and its failings as a currency.</p><p>Nonetheless, Suarez has pushed ahead with plans to integrate Bitcoin into Miami life. In February, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/miami-mayor-pushes-crypto-with-offer-to-pay-workers-in-bitcoin\">he</a> proposed paying city workers and collecting taxes in Bitcoin.</p><p>The city\u2019s commission approved the proposal in a 4-1 result.

It\u2019s an extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions, and the amount of energy that\u2019s consumed in processing those transactions is staggering.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>She also

And while this might seem like a huge technical conundrum, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/companies/input-output-iohk/\">IOHK</a>\u2019s engineers have actually come up with a rather simple, free-market-oriented solution.</p><h2>Cardano\u2019s Extended UTXO makes native token transactions possible</h2><p>Aside from opening up the world of DeFi to its users, the addition of <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/how-cardano-will-handle-native-tokens-on-its-platform/\">native tokens</a> to the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/cardano/\">Cardano</a> blockchain comes with a whole new set of technological benefits. The biggest advancement made possible by native tokens is Babel fees, a mechanism that enables users to pay transaction fees on the blockchain with user-defined tokens, rather than just using the blockchain\u2019s native token.</p><p>In practice, this means that any token issued on Cardano can be used to pay transaction fees, a move that will enable users to completely circumvent the use of ADA.</p><p>This is made possible by Cardano Extended<a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/cardano-parent-iohk-partners-with-nervos-to-improve-smart-contract-security/\"> UTXO</a> (EUTXO) model. Unlike <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/\">Ethereum</a>\u2019s account-based model, issuing a valid transaction on Cardano requires consuming one or more UTXOs. However, a UTXO on Cardano is able to carry a bundle that contains multiple different tokens, both fungible and non-fungible.</p><p>According to a <a href=\"https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/25/babel-fees/\">blog post</a> by Prof. Aggelos Kiayias, IOHK\u2019s chief scientist, this model makes it possible to issue a transaction that declares a liability denominated in ADA that\u2019s equal to the amount of fees that the transaction issuer is supposed to pay. This type of transaction is perceived as an open offer on the blockchain, asking interested parties to cover the liability. In return for covering the liability, the party would be paid a reward in the form of other tokens included in the transaction.</p><p>However, a transaction with a liability wouldn\u2019t be admissible to the blockchain by itself. Block producers are the ones tasked with creating a matching transaction that will absorb the liability, covering it both with ADA and the other tokens included in the transaction. As such, the transaction with the liability and its matching transaction become admissible to the ledger as a group.</p><h2>Stake pool operators become liquidity providers under Babel fees</h2><p>The only way for this mechanism to work is for the Cardano blockchain to introduce the notion of liquidity providers. These LPs are participants in the blockchain that are willing to issue matching transactions on the blockchain.</p><p>In the case of Babel fees, it\u2019s the stake pool operators that become the liquidity providers. They are incentivized by the market to provide exchange rates for specific native tokens they want to accept. Prof. Kiayias explained that any SPO can declare that they will accept a certain token for a fixed exchange rate, for example, 3:1 over ADA. If a transaction costs 0.16 ADA, the sender can declare a liability of 0.16 ADA and offer 0.48 of token X. Cardano\u2019s native asset model implements this as a single UTXO carrying a token bundle with the following specifications:</p><p><strong>ADA \u2192 -0.16, token X \u2192 0.48</strong></p><p>In the bundle, the liability is represented with a negative sign.</p><p>The stake pool operator that accepts the transaction recovers the liability from the mempool and issues a matching transaction consuming the UTXO with the liability. The matching transaction transfers 0.48 of token X to a new output, owned by the SPO.</p><p>What makes this rather simple mechanism revolutionary for blockchain technology is the fact that it\u2019s entirely op-in for SPOs. Each stake pool operator can determine their own policy and exchange rate irrespective of each other. This means that different stake pool operators can provide different exchange rates for the same token, pushing users issuing liability transactions to offer an amount of tokens that corresponds to the minimum, average, or even maximum of the posted exchange rates on the network.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIn this way, a natural trade-off arises between settlement time of liability transactions and the market value of tokens they offer,\u201d Kiayias explained in IOHK\u2019s blog post.</p></blockquote><p>To further promote the free market experience, Babel fees don\u2019t require SPOs to be the only entities on the network covering liabilities. Stake pool operators can partner with an external liquidity provider that will issue matching transactions. In addition to that, third-party providers can also independently on the network and issue matching transactions themselves, removing the need for stake pool operators.</p><p>Aside from Babel fees, this mechanism enables a variety of other innovative applications. While IOHK has remained mostly silent on the issue, its latest blog post highlighted atomic swaps for spot trades as one possible implementation of the mechanism.</p><p>According to Kiayias, the mechanism enabling negative quantities in token bundles will be implemented in the basic ledger rules of Cardano following the Mary Hard Fork. And while there\u2019s still no clear date as to when Babel fees will be enabled, it\u2019s safe to assume that they will see the light of day sometime shortly after the introduction of native assets.</p><div class=\"link-page\"></div><div class=\"posted-in\">Posted In: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/news/cardano/\" rel=\"tag\">Cardano</a>, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/altcoins/\"

Danielsson claims the concept of Bitcoin as money makes no sense. What\u2019s more, should it ever succeed, he envisions a world of great inequality which, as he alludes to, is contrary to its egalitarian principle.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cFortunately, the more successful bitcoin becomes, the more visible the perverse consequences and the internal contradictions become, so that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be discarded long before we get to that point. At which time, the price of bitcoin will head to zero.\u201d</p></blockquote><h2>Bitcoin continues to court controversy</h2><p>A record-breaking month saw Bitcoin hit $58k for the first time in its history. Although a dip this week sent jitters across the market, it\u2019s important to note that the fundamentals remain sound.</p><p>If anything, they grow stronger, as evidenced by the flurry of institutional interest over the past couple of weeks. And more recently, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/here-are-the-interesting-tidbits-from-coinbases-ipo-filing/\">Coinbase\u2019s S-1</a> filing, which many predict will bring an element of legitimacy to cryptocurrency.</p><p>Nonetheless, despite its achievements, it\u2019s fair to say that Bitcoin still attracts its share of hate and skepticism. Perhaps to a lesser extent now, having near tripled in value since December.</p><p>People who had previously dismissed it as a nothing burger fall into two camps. Those who are re-assessing and receptive to learning more and those who cling to outdated ideas and principles by doubling down on their skepticism.</p><p>Danielsson falls into the latter camp. Like many economists who examine Bitcoin, Danielsson views the leading cryptocurrency through an \u201cold-world\u201d lens. In doing so, several fundamental principles get overlooked.</p><p>For example, comparing on-demand money (M1) to Bitcoin has no basis. Few retailers accept Bitcoin directly because it\u2019s too slow and expensive to transact with. However, service providers such as <a href=\"https://bitpay.com/card\">BitPay</a> offer an intermediary service to convert crypto to fiat at the point of sale.</p><p>Its inefficiencies as a medium of exchange should not detract from its overall value. Just as retailers do not accept gold, it makes no sense to then say gold will go to zero on that basis.</p><h2>Woeful outlook</h2><p>Danielsson paints a hypothetical situation in which Bitcoin succeeds in eating the market cap of all world assets, fuelling an even greater split between the haves and have-nots.</p><p>No reply can satisfactorily respond to that scenario. However, in such a situation, the world would be a very different place, and Bitcoin should not be held responsible for those who refuse to adapt to change.</p><p>Bitcoin is a nascent technology that doesn\u2019t fit neatly into classical definitions of money per economic theory. As a decentralized and permissionless network, its undertaking is far more significant than merely exchanging value, as is the case with money.</p><p>Perhaps the bigger question at play is, why is the demand for Bitcoin skyrocketing?
