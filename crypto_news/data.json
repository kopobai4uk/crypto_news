Ideally, traders treat a crossover between a 50-day MA and 200-day MA as the benchmark indicator to determine their bullish bias. Meanwhile, when an asset\u2019s 20-period MA closes above its 50-period MA, it signals traders about an immediate buying sentiment in the market.</p>\n<h2>LINK Bullish Crossover</h2>\n<p>The LINK/USD exchange rate <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/link/chainlink-link-steadies-above-24/\" target=\"_blank\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">logged the 20-50 golden cross</a> on Tuesday as its bids rose to an intraday high of $30.89.

So Bitcoin is the highest quality property that they can buy.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>What\u2019s more, to answer the question, Saylor said that AML and KYC regulations are already in place to tackle regulators\u2019 most pressing concerns. While he conceded that further regulatory refinements might come in the future, he sees this as positive in that institutions would have more confidence to invest in Bitcoin. This, he believes, will result in triggering greater inflows.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The regulatory environment is already pretty clear on this, I mean AML KYC regulations have been applied across all of these exchanges.</p>\n<p>I think that there\u2019s a little more parity and precision that will be delivered in the coming one to two years.

So I think it\u2019ll be good for the industry in general.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Regulators Must Walk a Fine Line</h2>\n<p>Regulators are tasked with protecting investors. But at the same time, over-regulation of cryptocurrency is likely to stifle a burgeoning market that\u2019s still finding its feet.</p>\n<p>Although Saylor isn\u2019t concerned with regulation, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse believes the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), through its lawsuit against Ripple, implied there is more going on behind the scenes.</p><div class=\"jeg_ad jeg_ad_article jnews_content_inline_2_ads  \"><div class=\"ads-wrapper align-center \"><div class=\"ads_code\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(\"script\"); s.async = true; s.type = \"text/javascript\";s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}</script>\n<div class=\"plc452518\"></div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];\nvar abkw = window.abkw || '';\nvar plc452518 = window.plc452518 || 0;\n(function(){\nvar divs = document.querySelectorAll(\".plc452518:not([id])\");\nvar div = divs[divs.length-1];\ndiv.id = \"placement_452518_\"+plc452518;\nAdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452518, [728,90], 'placement_452518_'+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452518++, keywords: abkw, domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com', click:'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER' }});\n})();\n</script></div></div></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1341405037948493826\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener follow\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">Garlinghouse</a> said the actions of the SEC are a deliberate attempt to stifle cryptocurrency innovation.

This year the industry will have to adapt to new conditions.</p>\n<p>Conservation of low-margin projects, consolidation in the US shale industry, reorientation of oil majors towards ESG projects, closer coordination of OPEC + members, and a record level of world reserves \u2013 these are the trends that may be observed in the coming year.</p>\n<p>There is one absolutely positive moment- we can already observe how the oil market is rolling around with all the complexities caused by the pandemic. The oil price is rising, new deals are being made, and the leading players are starting to work on new long-term projects.</p>\n<h3>A general overview of the Oil market and events that happened</h3>\n<p>The collapse in demand due to the global quarantine, which peaked at 20 million barrels per day (b/d), coincided with a conflict between the OPEC + deal parties, which led to a price war uncontrolled increase in production. As a result, world oil reserves reached record levels, and oil prices fell below many extractive companies\u2019 costs. All these factors heavily scarred the oil market in 2020, however, it is worth noting that even in such a situation, many companies (mostly small ones) were able to benefit and now, on the rise in prices, they earn even more than they could if the oil market did not go through a crisis.</p>\n<p>One such example is Oil Max Capital company, which last year made a decisive step towards future earnings \u2013 we bought a record amount of oil at low prices.\u00a0 And even when prices continued to fall, our analysts did not sell stocks for next to anything but decided to take a waiting position for further earnings.\u00a0 As we can observe now, oil prices are growing, and with them, our income, as well as the income of our clients and partners.</p>\n<p><strong>OPEC +</strong></p>\n<p>Members of the OPEC + alliance stabilized the market balance by reducing their production, which amounted to 9.7 million b / d in May-July and was relaxed to 7.7 million b/d from August to the end of 2020. The OPEC + deal is the most critical mechanism for ensuring stability in the oil market. Controlled production limitation allows avoiding excess supply and maintaining a price level that is comfortable for oil producers.</p>\n<p><strong>Oil price and Covid-19 affection</strong></p>\n<p>Another optimistic premise is the hope of defeating the COVID-19 epidemic by the end of the first half of the year. Vaccinations have already started in the USA, Canada, and the UK, and introducing the vaccine in other developed countries is likely in the coming weeks. According to the IEA, demand for gasoline and diesel fuel in 20exceptional recover to 97-99% of the 2019 levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Oil production in the USA</strong></p>\n<p>In autumn 2020, against the background of price stabilization, the industry began to revive gradually. M&amp;A deals increased in the sector, and new drilling began to recover. In the baseline forecast, US production will not be a significant negative factor for oil prices, but the dynamics of key industry indicators should be kept in focus.</p>\n<p>Analytical houses\u2019 price forecasts vary. The average price at the end of 2021 may be in the range of 47-50 per barrel of Brent, while within a year, there may be fluctuations in a wide range of $ 40-60 per barrel.</p>\n<h3>How can people profit with Oil Max Capital?</h3>\n<p>As we can see, the oil market and its leading players are set for positive dynamics over the next year. However, how can ordinary people capitalize on this growth? Everything is quite simple. You need to choose related industries and companies such as Oil Max Capital and jump in.</p>\n<p>As we mentioned before, the company made a strategic step in 2020 and now can offer customers profitable investment opportunities. People don\u2019t need to understand investing, market quotes, and the oil industry to make money with Oil Max Capital. It is enough to choose an investment package that suits them personally and start earning from the first day of investment.</p>\n<p>The company has developed 24 different plans to suit various income levels. The basic tariff starts at just $10, but the profitability is twice the investment amount. Referral programs have also been developed, which significantly increases the size of clients\u2019 earnings.</p>\n<h3>Discounts</h3>\n<p>At the moment, the company has released a limited number of packages at special prices. Discounts range from %25 to %30 per package. Thus, for the Base package, the client will pay instead of $10 \u2013 only $7,5 while retaining the profitability of $0,33 per day. The duration of such a package is 2 months.</p>\n<p>If we look at more serious offers, for example, a four-month Advanced package currently costs $375 instead of $500 (the discount is 25 percent). At the same time, the level of profitability also remains at $11,11 per day.</p>\n<p>The most advantageous packages are considered to be 6 months long. A discounted Ultimate+ package can be purchased at a price of $7,000 instead of $10,000. The income will be $166,67 per day. Thus, you will receive more than $30,000 by investing $7,000, it\u2019s more than $23,000 of pure income. The offer is limited by time and numbers of discount packages issued.</p>\n<p>Useful links:</p>\n<p>Website <a href=\"https://oilmaxcapital.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">\u200b</a><a href=\"https://oilmaxcapital.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https://oilmaxcapital.com/en</a><br>\nFacebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/oilmaxcapital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener follow\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">\u200b</a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/oilmaxcapital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener follow\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">https://www.facebook.com/oilmaxcapital</a><br>\nTelegram <a href=\"https://t.me/oilmaxcapital\" target=\"_blank\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">\u200b</a><a href=\"https://t.me/oilmaxcapital\" target=\"_blank\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://t.me/oilmaxcapital</a><br>\nTwitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OilMaxCapital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener follow\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">\u200b</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/OilMaxCapital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener follow\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">https://twitter.com/OilMaxCapital</a><br>\nSubReddit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OilMaxCapital/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener follow\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">\u200b</a><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OilMaxCapital/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener follow\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">https://www.reddit.com/r/OilMaxCapital/</a></p>\n</div>"]},

More so, the implications of this if regulators decide to step up with tougher regulations at some future point.</p>\n<p>Saylor responded by saying companies must invest in assets to prosper and provide value to shareholders. He reiterated <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-rally-incoming-microstrategy-playbook-seminar-a-smash-hit/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">previous points</a> on choosing the best investment(s) to realize this goal.

So Bitcoin is the highest quality property that they can buy.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>What\u2019s more, to answer the question, Saylor said that AML and KYC regulations are already in place to tackle regulators\u2019 most pressing concerns. While he conceded that further regulatory refinements might come in the future, he sees this as positive in that institutions would have more confidence to invest in Bitcoin. This, he believes, will result in triggering greater inflows.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The regulatory environment is already pretty clear on this, I mean AML KYC regulations have been applied across all of these exchanges.</p>\n<p>I think that there\u2019s a little more parity and precision that will be delivered in the coming one to two years.

This year the industry will have to adapt to new conditions.</p>\n<p>Conservation of low-margin projects, consolidation in the US shale industry, reorientation of oil majors towards ESG projects, closer coordination of OPEC + members, and a record level of world reserves \u2013 these are the trends that may be observed in the coming year.</p>\n<p>There is one absolutely positive moment- we can already observe how the oil market is rolling around with all the complexities caused by the pandemic. The oil price is rising, new deals are being made, and the leading players are starting to work on new long-term projects.</p>\n<h3>A general overview of the Oil market and events that happened</h3>\n<p>The collapse in demand due to the global quarantine, which peaked at 20 million barrels per day (b/d), coincided with a conflict between the OPEC + deal parties, which led to a price war uncontrolled increase in production. As a result, world oil reserves reached record levels, and oil prices fell below many extractive companies\u2019 costs. All these factors heavily scarred the oil market in 2020, however, it is worth noting that even in such a situation, many companies (mostly small ones) were able to benefit and now, on the rise in prices, they earn even more than they could if the oil market did not go through a crisis.</p>\n<p>One such example is Oil Max Capital company, which last year made a decisive step towards future earnings \u2013 we bought a record amount of oil at low prices.\u00a0 And even when prices continued to fall, our analysts did not sell stocks for next to anything but decided to take a waiting position for further earnings.\u00a0 As we can observe now, oil prices are growing, and with them, our income, as well as the income of our clients and partners.</p>\n<p><strong>OPEC +</strong></p>\n<p>Members of the OPEC + alliance stabilized the market balance by reducing their production, which amounted to 9.7 million b / d in May-July and was relaxed to 7.7 million b/d from August to the end of 2020. The OPEC + deal is the most critical mechanism for ensuring stability in the oil market. Controlled production limitation allows avoiding excess supply and maintaining a price level that is comfortable for oil producers.</p>\n<p><strong>Oil price and Covid-19 affection</strong></p>\n<p>Another optimistic premise is the hope of defeating the COVID-19 epidemic by the end of the first half of the year. Vaccinations have already started in the USA, Canada, and the UK, and introducing the vaccine in other developed countries is likely in the coming weeks. According to the IEA, demand for gasoline and diesel fuel in 20exceptional recover to 97-99% of the 2019 levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Oil production in the USA</strong></p>\n<p>In autumn 2020, against the background of price stabilization, the industry began to revive gradually. M&amp;A deals increased in the sector, and new drilling began to recover. In the baseline forecast, US production will not be a significant negative factor for oil prices, but the dynamics of key industry indicators should be kept in focus.</p>\n<p>Analytical houses\u2019 price forecasts vary. The average price at the end of 2021 may be in the range of 47-50 per barrel of Brent, while within a year, there may be fluctuations in a wide range of $ 40-60 per barrel.</p>\n<h3>How can people profit with Oil Max Capital?</h3>\n<p>As we can see, the oil market and its leading players are set for positive dynamics over the next year. However, how can ordinary people capitalize on this growth? Everything is quite simple. You need to choose related industries and companies such as Oil Max Capital and jump in.</p>\n<p>As we mentioned before, the company made a strategic step in 2020 and now can offer customers profitable investment opportunities. People don\u2019t need to understand investing, market quotes, and the oil industry to make money with Oil Max Capital. It is enough to choose an investment package that suits them personally and start earning from the first day of investment.</p>\n<p>The company has developed 24 different plans to suit various income levels. The basic tariff starts at just $10, but the profitability is twice the investment amount. Referral programs have also been developed, which significantly increases the size of clients\u2019 earnings.</p>\n<h3>Discounts</h3>\n<p>At the moment, the company has released a limited number of packages at special prices. Discounts range from %25 to %30 per package. Thus, for the Base package, the client will pay instead of $10 \u2013 only $7,5 while retaining the profitability of $0,33 per day. The duration of such a package is 2 months.</p>\n<p>If we look at more serious offers, for example, a four-month Advanced package currently costs $375 instead of $500 (the discount is 25 percent). At the same time, the level of profitability also remains at $11,11 per day.</p>\n<p>The most advantageous packages are considered to be 6 months long. A discounted Ultimate+ package can be purchased at a price of $7,000 instead of $10,000. The income will be $166,67 per day. Thus, you will receive more than $30,000 by investing $7,000, it\u2019s more than $23,000 of pure income. The offer is limited by time and numbers of discount packages issued.</p>\n<p>Useful links:</p>\n<p>Website <a href=\"https://oilmaxcapital.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">\u200b</a><a href=\"https://oilmaxcapital.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https://oilmaxcapital.com/en</a><br>\nFacebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/oilmaxcapital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener follow\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">\u200b</a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/oilmaxcapital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener follow\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">https://www.facebook.com/oilmaxcapital</a><br>\nTelegram <a href=\"https://t.me/oilmaxcapital\" target=\"_blank\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">\u200b</a><a href=\"https://t.me/oilmaxcapital\" target=\"_blank\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://t.me/oilmaxcapital</a><br>\nTwitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OilMaxCapital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener follow\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">\u200b</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/OilMaxCapital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener follow\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">https://twitter.com/OilMaxCapital</a><br>\nSubReddit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OilMaxCapital/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener follow\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">\u200b</a><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OilMaxCapital/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener follow\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">https://www.reddit.com/r/OilMaxCapital/</a></p>\n</div>"]},

Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-goldman-sachs-exclusi-idUSKCN2AT390\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener follow\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">reported</a> Monday that Goldman is planning to launch a cryptocurrency trading desk three years after its shutdown. The report suggested that the bank would launch Bitcoin futures services on its platform by mid-March.</p>\n<p>According to data provided by <a href=\"https://cryptowat.ch/correlations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Correlation Watch</a>, the correlation efficiency between Bitcoin and Ethereum is 0.88. It means that Ethereum tends to tail Bitcoin\u2019s price trends positively, making it possible that it surges alongside the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency as its adoption booms across institutional investors via Goldman.</p>\n<p>Citigroup feels the same about the cryptocurrency sector as a whole. In a report released Tuesday, the global banking giant\u2019s Global Perspectives and Solutions thinktank <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-citigroup-warns-sp-500-fall/\" target=\"_blank\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">stated</a> that Bitcoin could become \u201cthe currency of choice for international trade.\u201d The BTC/USD exchange rate surged above $51,000 a day after the report came out.</p><div class=\"jeg_ad jeg_ad_article jnews_content_inline_2_ads  \"><div class=\"ads-wrapper align-center \"><div class=\"ads_code\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(\"script\"); s.async = true; s.type = \"text/javascript\";s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}</script>\n<div class=\"plc452518\"></div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];\nvar abkw = window.abkw || '';\nvar plc452518 = window.plc452518 || 0;\n(function(){\nvar divs = document.querySelectorAll(\".plc452518:not([id])\");\nvar div = divs[divs.length-1];\ndiv.id = \"placement_452518_\"+plc452518;\nAdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452518, [728,90], 'placement_452518_'+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452518++, keywords: abkw, domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com', click:'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER' }});\n})();\n</script></div></div></div>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI would not be surprised if [Ethereum] didn\u2019t blast off from here,\u201d an independent analyst noted after the token\u2019s rally on Wednesday. \u201cI would not like it going up yet.

Last week, the runup in US 10-year Treasury interest rates reduced investors\u2019 appetite for riskier assets as they sought cash. That pushed tech stocks, Bitcoin, and Ethereum lower.</p>\n<p>Should the Federal Reserve let the bond sell-off continue, Ethereum could stay under the risks of correction.</p><div class=\"jeg_ad jeg_ad_article jnews_content_inline_3_ads  \"><div class=\"ads-wrapper align-center \"><div class=\"ads_code\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(\"script\"); s.async = true; s.type = \"text/javascript\";s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());}</script>\n<div class=\"plc452519\"></div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];\nvar abkw = window.abkw || '';\nvar plc452519 = window.plc452519 || 0;\n(function(){\nvar divs = document.querySelectorAll(\".plc452519:not([id])\");\nvar div = divs[divs.length-1];\ndiv.id = \"placement_452519_\"+plc452519;\nAdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(172179, 452519, [728,90], 'placement_452519_'+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc452519++, keywords: abkw, domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com', click:'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER' }});\n})();\n</script></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"jeg_post_tags\"><span>Tags:</span> <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/cryptocurrency/\" rel=\"tag\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">cryptocurrency</a><a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/ethbtc/\" rel=\"tag\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">ethbtc</a><a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/ethereum/\" rel=\"tag\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">ethereum</a><a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/ethusd/\" rel=\"tag\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">ethusd</a><a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/ethusdt/\" rel=\"tag\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">ETHUSDT</a></div>\n</div>"]}
